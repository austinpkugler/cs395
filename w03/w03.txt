2^n - The most "Brute Force" way possible.

Implement a recursive algorithm for computing 2^n for any nonnegative integer n that is based on the formula 2^n = 2^(n−1) + 2^(n−1).

Yes. I really do want you to do it that way. Really. I am not kidding. (Let me know if you can think of an even less efficient way to do this.)

Your base case should be if(n<1)

The input should be n. The output should be 2^n.
