Minimum Distance (between elements of an array) - Better algorithm

Remember the following algorithm for finding the distance between the two closest elements in an array of numbers.

MinDistance(A[0..n-1]) {
   // Input: Array of A[0,,n-1]) of integers given as command line arguements
   // Output: Minimum distance between two of its elements
   dmin <- MAXINT
   for i<-0 to n-1 do
      for j<-0 to n-1 do
         if i!=j and |A[i]-A[j]| < dmin
            dmin = |A[i]-A[j]|
   return dmin

Make as many improvements as you can in this algorithmic solution to the problem.
If you need to, you may change the algorithm altogether; if not, improve the implementation given.
