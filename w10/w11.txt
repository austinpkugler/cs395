Insertion sort

Assume that A[n-2] elements are already sorted. All we need is to find an approp                                                                                                                                                             riate position for A[n − 1] among the sorted elements and insert it there. This                                                                                                                                                              is usually done by scanning the sorted subarray from right to left until the fir                                                                                                                                                             st element smaller than or equal to A[n − 1] is encountered to insert A[n − 1] r                                                                                                                                                             ight after that element. The resulting algorithm is called straight insertion so                                                                                                                                                             rt or simply insertion sort.

Though insertion sort is clearly based on a recursive idea, it is more efficient                                                                                                                                                              to implement this algorithm bottom up, i.e., iteratively. Starting with A[1]and                                                                                                                                                              ending with A[n − 1],A[i]is inserted in its appropriate place among the first i                                                                                                                                                              elements of the array that have been already sorted (but, unlike selection sort                                                                                                                                                             , are generally not in their final positions). Here is pseudocode of this algori                                                                                                                                                             thm.

Example of sorting with insertion sort. A vertical bar separates the sorted part                                                                                                                                                              of the array from the remaining elements; the element being inserted is in bold                                                                                                                                                             .
